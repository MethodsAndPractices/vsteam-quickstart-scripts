# Contributing to VSTeam Quickstart Scripts

I am truly grateful for all the support developing VSTeam Quickstart Scripts. It means a lot that you spend your time to help improve this collection of scripts for the community.

## Steps to contribute

1. Create a folder for your script
2. Create a Readme.md that describes how to use the script
3. Develop script and commit changes.

### Housekeeping

The VSTeam module runs on macOS, Windows and Linux. Therefore, **casing is very important**.  If your script only works on one platform please describe in the Readme.md file. Also note if this only support a specific version of TFS or requires a minimum API version.
